### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the 'node' command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use the 'hungy' and 'avaliableTime' inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
fuction whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availaleTime) {
    console.log("hungry is", hungry);
    console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
